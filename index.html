                Workers lose control over their creations and feel no ownership
                or pride in the products of their labor. Think of factory
                workers who never see the final product they help create.

                >
                Jobs become repetitive and mechanical, stripping away creativity
                and personal meaning. Work feels like something that happens to
                you rather than something you actively engage in.

                >
                We lose touch with our natural creativity and social
                connections, becoming isolated individuals focused mainly on
                economic survival rather than personal growth and community.

                Instead of working together, people are forced to compete
                against each other, breaking down the social bonds that make us
                human.

                Marx noticed something strange: in our economic system, we often
                treat relationships between people as if they were relationships

                focus on buying and selling things.

                Modern consumer culture takes this even further. We give brands

              Max Weber, another influential thinker, worried that modern
              society was becoming like an "iron cage" that traps people in

                Weber saw how modern society increasingly values efficiency,

                goodness. This makes people feel guilty for not constantly
